This project is similar to the [RoboFriends Rolodex](https://github.com/Kitkatnik/robofriends) project, but in this project I used functional components instead of class-based components as well as hooks.


### ðŸ§  What I learned

- How to write functional components
- How to use hooks (useState and useEffect)
- Practiced breaking down components, passing down props, and using event listeners to handle state changes
